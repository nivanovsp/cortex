# Implementation Plan: {task-name}

## Overview
{What we're implementing and why. Link to relevant requirements or architecture decisions.}

## Steps

1. **{Step description}**
   - Files: {files to modify or create}
   - Verification: {how to confirm this step is correct}

2. **{Step description}**
   - Files: {files to modify or create}
   - Verification: {how to confirm this step is correct}

3. **{Step description}**
   - Files: {files to modify or create}
   - Verification: {how to confirm this step is correct}

## Dependencies
- {What must exist before implementation starts}
- {Libraries, APIs, or modules required}

## Risks
- {What could go wrong during implementation}
- {Potential side effects on existing functionality}

## Verification Strategy
{How to confirm the full implementation is correct. Include test commands, manual checks, or review steps.}
