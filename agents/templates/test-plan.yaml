# Test Plan: {feature-under-test}

## Test Types

| Type | Scope | Approach |
|------|-------|----------|
| {unit/integration/e2e/etc.} | {what it covers} | {how tests are structured} |

## Coverage Targets
- {What must be tested, e.g., all public API endpoints}
- {Critical paths that require coverage}

## Test Cases

| ID | Description | Steps | Expected Result | Priority |
|----|-------------|-------|-----------------|----------|
| {TC-001} | {what is being tested} | {steps to execute} | {expected outcome} | {high/medium/low} |
| {TC-002} | {what is being tested} | {steps to execute} | {expected outcome} | {priority} |

## Test Data Requirements
- {Data needed, e.g., seed database with sample users}
- {Fixtures or mocks required}

## Test Environments
- {Environment description, e.g., local with SQLite, CI with PostgreSQL}

## Risks and Mitigations
- {Testing risk, e.g., flaky external API} — Mitigation: {e.g., use mocks}
